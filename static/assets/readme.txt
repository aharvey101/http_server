This is a sample text file to demonstrate the Rust HTTP Server's ability to:

1. Serve different file types
2. Handle MIME types correctly
3. Provide directory listing functionality
4. Serve static content efficiently

The server can handle various file formats including:
- HTML files (.html)
- CSS stylesheets (.css) 
- JavaScript files (.js)
- Plain text files (.txt)
- JSON data files (.json)
- Image files (.png, .jpg, .gif)

All of this is implemented from scratch in Rust without external dependencies!
